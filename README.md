## Project Description

"PeePy" is a whimsical Python package designed to make coding concepts more accessible and fun for young children and beginners. This package replaces traditional functions and built-in class names with playful and nonsensical baby words, creating an entertaining and imaginative way to introduce coding principles to very young learners.

Key Feature of PeePy:

Nonsensical Naming: PeePy replaces standard Python function and class names with baby words and playful terms. For example, it might rename "print" to "puhoo" and "if" to "fuh."

## Clear Instructions and Code Examples

- how a developer who wants to import your project into their own code can do so - include documentation for all functions in your package and a link to an example Python program that uses each of them.

- how a developer who wants to contribute to your project can set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and build and test your package for themselves.

## Include a badge at the top of the README.md file showing the result of the latest build/test workflow run.

## Include a link to your package's page on the PyPI website.
