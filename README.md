## Project Description

## Clear Instructions and Code Examples

- how a developer who wants to import your project into their own code can do so - include documentation for all functions in your package and a link to an example Python program that uses each of them.

- how a developer who wants to contribute to your project can set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and build and test your package for themselves.

## Include a badge at the top of the README.md file showing the result of the latest build/test workflow run.

## Include a link to your package's page on the PyPI website.
